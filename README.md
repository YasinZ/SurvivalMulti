# SurvivalMulti

This was a game I developed along with two other students. We wanted to create a team based surivival game. We wanted to combine all the mechanics of our game to effect both players. We wanted health and hunger as well as the items they collected and enemies they killed to be synced. Unfortunently we had to cut some corners to get the game to be playable in the first place. We had a big ideas for the game but in the end had to settle for a less flashy game for something that actually works. Some of these assets were from the Unity asset store as well as ones we created. We worked together to create the necessary scripts but I, with the help of Unity's mutliplayer service, got the networking set up. Overall, useful experience gained in both knowing how long features will take to create as well as valuable insite into networking.
